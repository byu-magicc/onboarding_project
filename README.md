# MAGICC Lab Onboarding Project

This repository contains project files for the MAGICC Lab onboarding project.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be a fun ~2-week project that prospective students and volunteers can do to understand more about the tools we use in the MAGICC lab.

### Expected outcomes

* Gain exposure to 
  * [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)
  * `git`
  * Python/C++
  * Linux
  * (optional) Docker
* Set up ROSflight on your computer
* Write your own ROS 2 node that controls a simulated multirotor
* Have fun!

## Project Assignment
Mr. Karl Maeser has unfortunately found himself stuck inside a chalk circle, and hasn't been able to find any BYU Creamery chocolate milk for days!
He is located at the end of a hallway, unable to move.

Luckily, you happen to have a quadrotor that just happens to have a case of BYU Creamery chocolate milk already loaded up!
Your assignment is to deliver the goods to Mr. Maeser as quick as you can.
But watch out!
Hit any walls and your quadrotor will crash (not shown)!

#### Your Task:
Design a controller that guides your quadrotor through a simulated hallway and arrives close to Mr. Maeser.
Avoid all walls.

#### Deliverables:
- A video link of your quadrotor completing the mission (screen recording, uploaded to YouTube or similar)
- The minimum distance to the walls from your run (produced by this package)
- A link to your forked repository with your solution code

## Instructions

1. Follow the [project instructions](docs/project-instructions.md) to complete your project.
2. After successfully getting Mr. Maeser his goods, [submit your results to the leaderboard](docs/leaderboard-instructions.md).
